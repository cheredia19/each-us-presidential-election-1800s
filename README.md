## 1884 | Grover Cleveland (D) v. James Blaine (R)

The United States presidential election of 1884 featured excessive mudslinging and personal acrimony.

**Grover Cleveland**, the Democratic nominee, had fathered an illegitimate child years earlier in Buffalo. He had taken full financial responsibility for his offspring and publicly acknowledged that he had made a mistake. 

His counterpart, Republican **James G. Blaine**, apparently engaged in questionable investment schemes while on the public payroll. Much of the campaign furor revolved around the difference between private and public misdeeds.

On November 4, 1884, Cleveland narrowly defeated Blaine to become the first Democrat elected President of the United States since James Buchanan 28 years ago (before the American Civil War). 

New York decided the election, awarding Cleveland the state's 36 electors by just 1,047 votes.

## 1888 | Benjamin Harrison (R) v. Grover Cleveland (D)

The tariff was the biggest issue in the United States 1888 presidential election. **Benjamin Harrison**, the Republican candidate, opposed tariff reduction, while the policies of incumbent President **Grover Cleveland** on pensions, the currency, and tariff reform had made enemies among veterans, farmers, and industrialists. 

Even with this handicap, the Democrat had more popular votes than Harrison. However, Harrison received more support from the Electoral College and won the election.

It was the third time in history (it previously happened in 1824 and 1876) when the popular vote winner was defeated. It did not occur again until the 2000 election (George W. Bush v. Al Gore).

## 1892 | Grover Cleveland (D) v. Benjamin Harrison (R)

Former President, Democratic candidate **Grover Cleveland** ran for re-election against the incumbent, Republican **Benjamin Harrison**, who was also running for re-election. 

The winner would become the only person in U.S. history elected to a second, non-consecutive presidential term, a feat that can be achieved by Donald Trump if he wins the 2024 residential election. 

Cleveland had won the popular vote against Harrison in 1888 but lost the electoral vote which cost him re-election. This time, he won the popular and electoral votes. The Democrat nominee enjoyed solid support in the South and the Swing States, and managed to draw votes from Republicans who were unhappy with Harrison

The campaign centered mainly on the issue of a sound currency. The new Populist Party, formed by groups from the Grange, the Farmers' Alliances, and the Knights of Labor, polled more than a million votes.

## 1896 | William McKinley (R) v. William Jennings Bryan (D)

The 1896 presidential election was on November 3, 1896, with Republican **William McKinley** and 36-year-old Democrat **William Jennings Bryan** battling in a campaign considered by historians a [turning point in American history](https://www.proquest.com/docview/213739688?sourcetype=Scholarly%20Journals).

The race occurred during the [Panic of 1893](https://www.historylink.org/file/20874) economic depression. McKinley conducted a "front porch campaign" in which he remained at home in Canton, Ohio, and lots of supporters were brought in to hear him deliver short speeches tailored for his audiences.

In contrast, Bryan traveled widely and asked his audiences for their votes. His campaign train stopped at towns and hamlets and the candidate delighted his largely rural listeners with his flamboyant oratory. 

In the early fall of 1896, many observers believed Bryan was the frontrunner, but in the end, McKinley achieved the victory. Massive Republican advertising and the faltering economy worked heavily against the Democrats.
